Simple grey theme for Piwigo
============================

*Simple  grey*  is a  theme  for *Piwigo*  gallery  software.  This theme  was
inspired  by *gally  /  Graphite* theme  for  Piwigo, and  *Carbon* theme  for
Gallery, with the goal to simplify the design up to go to basics: the photos !
You can also find some variants (Sunset, Black, White) in Piwigo extensions.
